.# Abstract

SMTP Mail Transfer Agent Strict Transport Security (SMTP STS) is a mechanism
enabling mail service providers to declare their ability to receive TLS-secured
connections and an expected validity of certificates presented by their MX
hosts, and to specify whether sending SMTP servers should refuse to deliver to
MX hosts that do not offer TLS with a trusted server certificate.


{mainmatter}

# Introduction

The STARTTLS extension to SMTP [@!RFC3207] allows SMTP clients and hosts to
negotiate the use of a TLS channel for secure mail transmission.

While such _opportunistic_ encryption protocols provide a high barrier against
passive man-in-the-middle traffic interception, any attacker who can delete
parts of the SMTP session (such as the "250 STARTTLS" response) or who can
redirect the entire SMTP session (perhaps by overwriting the resolved MX record
of the delivery domain) can perform downgrade or interception attacks.

This document defines a mechanism for recipient domains to publish policies
specifying:

   * whether MTAs sending mail to this domain can expect TLS support
   * expected validity of server certificates presented by the domain's MX hosts
   * what a conforming client should do with messages when TLS cannot be
     successfully negotiated

## Terminology

The keywords **MUST**, **MUST NOT**, **REQUIRED**, **SHALL**, **SHALL NOT**,
**SHOULD**, **SHOULD NOT**, **RECOMMENDED**, **MAY**, and **OPTIONAL**, when
they appear in this document, are to be interpreted as described in [@!RFC2119].

We also define the following terms for further use in this document:

* STS Policy: A committment by the Policy Domain to support PKIX authenticated
  TLS for the specified MX hosts.
* Policy Domain: The domain for which an STS Policy is defined. (For
  example, when sending mail to "alice@example.com", the policy domain is
  "example.com".)
* Policy Authentication: Authentication of the STS policy retrieved for a recipient
  domain by the sender.

# Related Technologies

The DANE TLSA record [@!RFC7672] is similar, in that DANE is also designed to
upgrade opportunistic, unauthenticated encryption into required, authenticated
encryption. DANE requires DNSSEC [@!RFC4033] for authentication; the mechanism
described here instead relies on certificate authorities (CAs) and does not
require DNSSEC.  For a thorough discussion of this trade-off, see the section
_Security_ _Considerations_.

In addition, SMTP STS provides an optional report-only mode, enabling soft
deployments to detect policy failures.

# Policy Discovery

SMTP STS policies are distributed via HTTPS from a "well-known" [@!RFC5785] path served
within the Policy Domain, and their presence and current version are indicated
by a TXT record at the Policy Domain. These TXT records additionally contain a
policy `id` field, allowing sending MTAs to check the currency of a cached
policy without performing an HTTPS request.

To discover if a recipient domain implements MTA-STS, a sender need only
resolve a single TXT record. To see if an updated policy is
available for a domain for which the sender has a previously cached policy, the
sender need only check the TXT record's version `id` against the cached value.

## MTA-STS TXT Records

The MTA-STS TXT record is a TXT record with the name `_mta-sts` at the Policy
Domain. For the domain `example.com`, this record would be
`_mta-sts.example.com`.  MTA-STS TXT records MUST be US-ASCII,
semicolon-separated key/value pairs containing the following fields:

* `v`: (plain-text, required). Currently only "STSv1" is supported.
* `id`: (plain-text, required). A short string used to track policy updates.
  This string MUST uniquely identify a given instance of a policy, such that 
  senders can determine when the policy has been updated by comparing to the `id`
  of a previously seen policy. There is no implied ordering of `id` fields
  between revisions.

An example TXT record is as below:

`_mta-sts.example.com.  IN TXT "v=STSv1; id=20160831085700Z;"`

The formal definition of the `_mta-sts` TXT record, defined using [@!RFC5234],
is as follows:

    sts-text-record = sts-version *WSP %x3B *WSP sts-id [%x3B]

    sts-version     = "v" *WSP "=" *WSP %x53 %x54        ; "STSv1" 
                      %x53 %x76 %x31

    sts-id          = "id" *WSP "=" *WSP 1*32(ALPHA / DIGIT) 

If multiple TXT records for `_mta-sts` are returned by the resolver, records
which do not begin with `v=STSv1;` are discarded. If the number of resulting
records is not one, senders MUST assume the recipient domain does not implement
MTA STS and skip the remaining steps of policy discovery.

## MTA-STS Policies

The policy itself is a JSON [@!RFC4627] object served via the HTTPS GET method from
the fixed [@!RFC5785] "well-known" path of `.well-known/mta-sts.json` served by
the `mta-sts` host at the Policy Domain. Thus for `example.com` the path is
`https://mta-sts.example.com/.well-known/mta-sts.json`.

This JSON object contains the following key/value pairs:

* `version`: (plain-text, required). Currently only "STSv1" is supported.
* `mode`: (plain-text, required). Either "enforce" or "report", indicating the
  expected behavior of a sending MTA in the case of a policy validation failure.
* `max_age`: Max lifetime of the policy (plain-text non-negative integer
  seconds, required).  Well-behaved clients SHOULD cache a policy for up to this value
  from last policy fetch time. To mitigate the risks of attacks at policy
  refresh time, it is expected that this value typically be in the range of
  weeks or greater.
* `mx`: MX patterns (list of plain-text MX match strings, required). One or more
  patterns matching the expected MX for this domain. For example,
  `["*.example.com", "*.example.net"]` indicates that mail for this domain might
  be handled by any MX with a hostname at `example.com` or `example.net`. Valid
  patterns can be either hostname literals (e.g. "mx1.example.com") or wildcard
  matches, so long as the wildcard occupies the full left-most label in the
  pattern. (Thus `*.example.com` is valid but `mx*.example.com` is not.)

An example JSON policy is as below:

```
{
  "version": "STSv1",
  "mode": "enforce",
  "mx": ["*.mail.example.com"],
  "max_age": 123456
}
```

A lenient parser SHOULD accept TXT records and policy files which are
syntactically valid (i.e. valid key-value pairs separated by semi-colons for
TXT records and valid JSON for policy files) and implementing a superset of this
specification, in which case unknown fields SHALL be ignored.

## HTTPS Policy Fetching

When fetching a new policy or updating a policy, the HTTPS endpoint MUST present
a TLS certificate which is valid for the `mta-sts` host (as described in
[@!RFC6125]), chain to a root CA that is trusted by the sending MTA, and be
non-expired. It is expected that sending MTAs use a set of trusted CAs similar
to those in widely deployed Web browsers and operating systems.

HTTP 3xx redirects MUST NOT be followed.

Senders may wish to rate-limit the frequency of attempts to fetch the HTTPS
endpoint even if a valid TXT record for the recipient domain exists. In the case
that the HTTPS GET fails, we suggest implementions may limit further attempts to
a period of five minutes or longer per version ID, to avoid overwhelming
resource-constrained recipients with cascading failures.

Senders MAY impose a timeout on the HTTPS GET to avoid long delays imposed by
attempted policy updates. A suggested timeout is one minute; policy hosts SHOULD
respond to requests with a complete policy body within that timeout.

## Policy Selection for Smart Hosts

When sending mail via a "smart host"--an intermediate SMTP relay rather than the
message recipient's server--compliant senders MUST treat the smart host domain
as the policy domain for the purposes of policy discovery and application.

# Policy Validation

When sending to an MX at a domain for which the sender has a valid and
non-expired SMTP MTA-STS policy, a sending MTA honoring SMTP STS MUST validate:

1. That the recipient MX matches the `mx` pattern from the recipient domain's
   policy.
2. That the recipient MX supports STARTTLS and offers a valid PKIX based TLS
   certificate.

This section does not dictate the behavior of sending MTAs when policies fail to
validate; in particular, validation failures of policies which specify `report`
mode MUST NOT be interpreted as delivery failures, as described in the section
_Policy_ _Application_.

## MX Matching

When delivering mail for the Policy Domain to a recipient MX host, the sender
validates the MX match against the `mx` pattern from the applied policy. The
semantics for these patterns are those found in section 6.4 of [@!RFC6125].

Patterns may contain a wildcard character `*` which matches any single domain
name component or component fragment, though only as the leftmost component in a
pattern. For example, `*.example.com` is a valid pattern, but
`foo.*.example.com` is not. Given the pattern `*.example.com`, `mx1.example.com`
is a valid MX host, but `1234.dhcp.example.com` is not.

## MX Certificate Validation

The certificate presented by the receiving MX MUST be valid for the MX hostname
and chain to a root CA that is trusted by the sending MTA. The certificate MUST
have a CN or SAN matching the MX hostname (as described in [@!RFC6125]) and be
non-expired.

In the case of an "implicit" MX record (as specified in [@!RFC2821]) where no MX
RR exists for the recipient domain but there is an A RR, the MX hostname is
assumed to be that of the A RR and should be validated as such.

# Policy Application

When sending to an MX at a domain for which the sender has a valid, non-expired
STS policy, a sending MTA honoring SMTP STS applies the result of a policy
validation one of two ways, depending on the value of the policy `mode` field:

1. `report`: In this mode, sending MTAs merely send a report (as described in
   the TLSRPT specification (TODO: add ref)) indicating policy application
   failures.

2. `enforce`: In this mode, sending MTAs treat STS policy failures as a mail
   delivery error, and MUST NOT deliver the message to this host.

When a message fails to deliver due to an `enforce` policy, a compliant MTA MUST
check for the presence of an updated policy at the Policy Domain before
permanently failing to deliver the message. This allows implementing domains to
update long-lived policies on the fly.

Finally, in both `enforce` and `report` modes, failures to deliver in compliance
with the applied policy result in failure reports to the policy domain, as
described in the TLSRPT specification (TODO: add ref).

## MX Preference

When applying a policy, sending MTAs SHOULD select recipient MXs by first
eliminating any MXs at lower priority than the current host (if in the MX
candidate set), then eliminating any non-matching (as specified by the STS
Policy) MX hosts from the candidate MX set, and then attempting delivery to
matching hosts as indicated by their MX priority, until delivery succeeds or the
MX candidate set is empty.

## Policy Application Control Flow

An example control flow for a compliant sender consists of the following steps:

1. Check for a cached policy whose time-since-fetch has not exceeded its
   `max_age`. If none exists, attempt to fetch a new policy. (Optionally,
   sending MTAs may unconditionally check for a new policy at this step.)
2. Filter candidate MXs against the current policy.
3. If no candidate MXs are valid and the policy mode is `enforce`, temporarily
   fail the message.  (Otherwise, generate a failure report but deliver as
   though MTA STS were not implemented.)
4. For each candidate MX, in order of MX priority, attempt to deliver the
   message, enforcing STARTTLS and the MX host's PKIX certificate validation.
5. Upon message retries, a message MAY be permanently failed following first
   checking for the presence of a new policy (as indicated by the `id` field in
   the `_mta-sts` TXT record).

# Operational Considerations

## Policy Updates

Updating the policy requires that the owner make changes in two places: the
`_mta-sts` TXT record in the Policy Domain's DNS zone and at the corresponding
HTTPS endpoint. In the case where the HTTPS endpoint has been updated but the
TXT record has not yet been, senders will not know there is a new policy
released and may thus continue to use old, previously cached versions.
Recipients should thus expect a policy will continue to be used by senders until
both the HTTPS and TXT endpoints are updated and the TXT record's TTL has
passed.

# IANA Considerations

A new .well-known URI will be registered in the Well-Known URIs registry as
described below:

URI Suffix: mta-sts.json
Change Controller: IETF

# Security Considerations

SMTP Strict Transport Security attempts to protect against an active attacker
who wishes to intercept or tamper with mail between hosts who support STARTTLS.
There are two classes of attacks considered:

1. Foiling TLS negotiation, for example by deleting the "250 STARTTLS" response
   from a server or altering TLS session negotiation. This would result in the
   SMTP session occurring over plaintext, despite both parties supporting TLS.

2. Impersonating the destination mail server, whereby the sender might deliver
   the message to an impostor, who could then monitor and/or modify messages
   despite opportunistic TLS. This impersonation could be accomplished by
   spoofing the DNS MX record for the recipient domain, or by redirecting client
   connections intended for the legitimate recipient server (for example, by
   altering BGP routing tables).

SMTP Strict Transport Security relies on certificate validation via PKIX based
TLS identity checking [@!RFC6125]. Attackers who are able to obtain a valid
certificate for the targeted recipient mail service (e.g. by compromising a
certificate authority) are thus able to circumvent STS authentication.

Since we use DNS TXT records for policy discovery, an attacker who is able to
block DNS responses can suppress the discovery of an STS Policy, making the
Policy Domain appear not to have an STS Policy. The sender policy cache is
designed to resist this attack.

We additionally consider the Denial of Service risk posed by an attacker who can
modify the DNS records for a victim domain. Absent SMTP STS, such an attacker
can cause a sending MTA to cache invalid MX records for a long TTL. With SMTP
STS, the attacker can additionally advertise a new, long-`max_age` SMTP STS
policy with `mx` constraints that validate the malicious MX record, causing
senders to cache the policy and refuse to deliver messages once the victim has
resecured the MX records.

This attack is mitigated in part by the ability of a victim domain to (at any
time) publish a new policy updating the cached, malicious policy, though this
does require the victim domain to both obtain a valid CA-signed certificate and
to understand and properly configure SMTP STS.

Similarly, we consider the possibilty of domains that deliberately allow
untrusted users to serve untrusted content on user-specified subdomains. In some
cases (e.g. the service Tumblr.com) this takes the form of providing HTTPS
hosting of user-registered subdomains; in other cases (e.g. dynamic DNS
providers) this takes the form of allowing untrusted users to register custom
DNS records at the provider's domain.

In these cases, there is a risk that untrusted users would be able to serve
custom content at the `mta-sts` host, including serving an illegitimate SMTP STS
policy.  We believe this attack is rendered more difficult by the need for the
attacker to both inject malicious (but temporarily working) MX records and also
serve the `_mta-sts` TXT record on the same domain--something not, to our
knowledge, widely provided to untrusted users. This attack is additionally
mitigated by the aforementioned ability for a victim domain to update an invalid
policy at any future date.

Even if an attacker cannot modify a served policy, the potential exists for
configurations that allow attackers on the same domain to receive mail for that
domain. For example, an easy configuration option when authoring an STS Policy
for `example.com` is to set the `mx` equal to `*.example.com`; recipient domains
must consider in this case the risk that any user possessing a valid hostname
and CA-signed certificate (for example, `dhcp-123.example.com`) will, from the
perspective of STS Policy validation, be a valid MX host for that domain.

# Appendix 1: Domain Owner STS example record

## Example 1

The owner of `example.com` wishes to begin using STS with a policy that will
solicit reports from receivers without affecting how the messages are
processed, in order to verify the identity of MXs that handle mail for
`example.com`, confirm that TLS is correctly used, and ensure that certificates
presented by the recipient MX validate.

# Appendix 2: Message delivery pseudocode

Below is pseudocode demonstrating the logic of a complaint sending MTA. This
implements the "two-pass" approach, first attempting delivery with a newly
fetched policy (if present) before falling back to a cached policy (if present).
