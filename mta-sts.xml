<abstract>
<t>SMTP Mail Transfer Agent Strict Transport Security (MTA-STS) is a mechanism
enabling mail service providers to declare their ability to receive Transport
Layer Security (TLS) secure SMTP connections, and to specify whether sending
SMTP servers should refuse to deliver to MX hosts that do not offer TLS with a
trusted server certificate.
</t>
</abstract>

<section anchor="introduction" title="Introduction">
<t>The STARTTLS extension to SMTP <xref target="RFC3207"/> allows SMTP clients and hosts to
negotiate the use of a TLS channel for encrypted mail transmission.
</t>
<t>While this opportunistic encryption protocol by itself provides a high barrier
against passive man-in-the-middle traffic interception, any attacker who can
delete parts of the SMTP session (such as the &quot;250 STARTTLS&quot; response) or who
can redirect the entire SMTP session (perhaps by overwriting the resolved MX
record of the delivery domain) can perform downgrade or interception attacks.
</t>
<t>This document defines a mechanism for recipient domains to publish policies
specifying:
</t>
<t>
<list style="symbols">
<t>whether MTAs sending mail to this domain can expect PKIX-authenticated TLS
 support</t>
<t>what a conforming client should do with messages when TLS cannot be
 successfully negotiated</t>
</list>
</t>

<section anchor="terminology" title="Terminology">
<t>The keywords MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHALL, SHALL NOT,
SHOULD, SHOULD NOT, RECOMMENDED, MAY, and OPTIONAL, when
they appear in this document, are to be interpreted as described in <xref target="RFC2119"/>.
</t>
<t>We also define the following terms for further use in this document:
</t>
<t>
<list style="symbols">
<t>MTA-STS Policy: A commitment by the Policy Domain to support PKIX authenticated
TLS for the specified MX hosts.</t>
<t>Policy Domain: The domain for which an MTA-STS Policy is defined. This is the
next-hop domain; when sending mail to &quot;alice@example.com&quot; this would ordinarly
be &quot;example.com&quot;, but this may be overriden by explicit routing rules (as
described in <xref target="policy-selection-for-smart-hosts-and-subdomains"/>,
&quot;Policy Selection for Smart Hosts and Subdomains&quot;).</t>
</list>
</t>
</section>
</section>

<section anchor="related-technologies" title="Related Technologies">
<t>The DANE TLSA record <xref target="RFC7672"/> is similar, in that DANE is also designed to
upgrade unauthenticated encryption or plaintext transmission into authenticated,
downgrade-resistent encrypted tarnsmission. DANE requires DNSSEC <xref target="RFC4033"/> for
authentication; the mechanism described here instead relies on certificate
authorities (CAs) and does not require DNSSEC, at a cost of risking malicious
downgrades.  For a thorough discussion of this trade-off, see
<xref target="security-considerations"/>, &quot;Security Considerations&quot;.
</t>
<t>In addition, MTA-STS provides an optional report-only mode, enabling soft
deployments to detect policy failures; partial deployments can be achieved in
DANE by deploying TLSA records only for some of a domain's MXs, but such a
mechanism is not possible for the per-domain policies used by MTA-STS.
</t>
<t>The primary motivation of MTA-STS is to provide a mechanism for domains to
upgrade their transport security even when deploying DNSSEC is undesirable or
impractical. However, MTA-STS is designed not to interfere with DANE deployments
when the two overlap; in particular, senders who implement MTA-STS validation
MUST NOT allow a &quot;valid&quot; or &quot;report-only&quot; MTA-STS validation to override a
failing DANE validation.
</t>
</section>

<section anchor="policy-discovery" title="Policy Discovery">
<t>MTA-STS policies are distributed via HTTPS from a &quot;well-known&quot; <xref target="RFC5785"/> path served
within the Policy Domain, and their presence and current version are indicated
by a TXT record at the Policy Domain. These TXT records additionally contain a
policy <spanx style="verb">id</spanx> field, allowing sending MTAs to check the currency of a cached
policy without performing an HTTPS request.
</t>
<t>To discover if a recipient domain implements MTA-STS, a sender need only resolve
a single TXT record. To see if an updated policy is available for a domain for
which the sender has a previously cached policy, the sender need only check the
TXT record's version <spanx style="verb">id</spanx> against the cached value.
</t>

<section anchor="mtasts-txt-records" title="MTA-STS TXT Records">
<t>The MTA-STS TXT record is a TXT record with the name <spanx style="verb">_mta-sts</spanx> at the Policy
Domain. For the domain <spanx style="verb">example.com</spanx>, this record would be
<spanx style="verb">_mta-sts.example.com</spanx>.  MTA-STS TXT records MUST be US-ASCII,
semicolon-separated key/value pairs containing the following fields:
</t>
<t>
<list style="symbols">
<t><spanx style="verb">v</spanx>: (plain-text, required). Currently only &quot;STSv1&quot; is supported.</t>
<t><spanx style="verb">id</spanx>: (plain-text, required). A short string used to track policy updates.
This string MUST uniquely identify a given instance of a policy, such that
senders can determine when the policy has been updated by comparing to the <spanx style="verb">id</spanx>
of a previously seen policy. There is no implied ordering of <spanx style="verb">id</spanx> fields
between revisions.</t>
</list>
</t>
<t>An example TXT record is as below:
</t>
<t><spanx style="verb">_mta-sts.example.com.  IN TXT "v=STSv1; id=20160831085700Z;"</spanx>
</t>
<t>The formal definition of the <spanx style="verb">_mta-sts</spanx> TXT record, defined using <xref target="RFC7405"/>,
is as follows:
</t>

<figure align="center"><artwork align="center">
sts-text-record = sts-version field-delim sts-id
                  [field-delim [sts-extensions]]

field-delim     = *WSP ";" *WSP

sts-version     = %s"v=STSv1"

sts-id          = %s"id=" 1*32(ALPHA / DIGIT)        ; id=...

sts-extensions  = sts-extension *(field-delim sts-extension)
                  [field-delim]                      ; extension fields

sts-extension   = sts-ext-name "=" sts-ext-value     ; name=value

sts-ext-name    = (ALPHA / DIGIT) *31(ALPHA / DIGIT / "_" / "-" / ".")

sts-ext-value   = 1*(%x21-3A / %x3C / %x3E-7E)       ; chars excluding
                                                     ; "=", ";", SP, and
                                                     ; control chars
</artwork></figure>
<t>If multiple TXT records for <spanx style="verb">_mta-sts</spanx> are returned by the resolver, records
which do not begin with <spanx style="verb">v=STSv1;</spanx> are discarded. If the number of resulting
records is not one, senders MUST assume the recipient domain does not implement
MTA-STS and skip the remaining steps of policy discovery.
</t>
</section>

<section anchor="mtasts-policies" title="MTA-STS Policies">
<t>The policy itself is a key-value file served via the HTTPS GET method
from the fixed <xref target="RFC5785"/> &quot;well-known&quot; path of <spanx style="verb">.well-known/mta-sts.policy</spanx>
served by the <spanx style="verb">mta-sts</spanx> host at the Policy Domain. Thus for <spanx style="verb">example.com</spanx> the
path is <spanx style="verb">https://mta-sts.example.com/.well-known/mta-sts.policy</spanx>.
</t>
<t>This key-value file contains the following key/value pairs:
</t>
<t>
<list style="symbols">
<t><spanx style="verb">version</spanx>: (plain-text, required). Currently only &quot;STSv1&quot; is supported.</t>
<t><spanx style="verb">mode</spanx>: (plain-text, required). Either &quot;enforce&quot; or &quot;report&quot;, indicating the
expected behavior of a sending MTA in the case of a policy validation failure.</t>
<t><spanx style="verb">max_age</spanx>: Max lifetime of the policy (plain-text non-negative integer
seconds, required).  Well-behaved clients SHOULD cache a policy for up to this value
from last policy fetch time. To mitigate the risks of attacks at policy
refresh time, it is expected that this value typically be in the range of
weeks or greater.</t>
<t><spanx style="verb">mx</spanx>: MX identity patterns (list of plain-text strings, required). One or more
patterns matching a Common Name (<xref target="RFC6125"/>) or Subject Alternative Name
(<xref target="RFC5280"/>) DNS-ID present in the X.509 certificate presented by any MX
receiving mail for this domain.  For example:
<spanx style="verb">mx: mail.example.com
mx: .example.net</spanx>
indicates that mail for this domain might be handled by any
MX with a certificate valid for a host at <spanx style="verb">mail.example.com</spanx> or <spanx style="verb">example.net</spanx>.
Valid patterns can be either fully specified names (<spanx style="verb">example.com</spanx>) or suffixes
(<spanx style="verb">.example.net</spanx>) matching the right-hand parts of a server's identity; the
latter case are distinguished by a leading period.  If there are more than
one MX specified by the policy, they MUST be on separate lines within the
policy file.  In the case of Internationalized Domain Names (<xref target="RFC5891"/>),
the MX MUST specify the Punycode-encoded A-label <xref target="RFC3492"/> and not the
Unicode-encoded U-label. The full semantics of certificate validation are
described in <xref target="mx-certificate-validation"/>, &quot;MX Certificate Validation.&quot;</t>
</list>
</t>
<t>An example policy is as below:
</t>

<figure align="center"><artwork align="center">
version: STSv1
mode: enforce
mx: mail.example.com
mx: .example.net
mx: backupmx.example.com
max_age: 123456
</artwork></figure>
<t>Parsers MUST accept TXT records and policy files which are syntactically valid
(i.e. valid key-value pairs separated by semi-colons for TXT records) and
implementing a superset of this specification, in which case unknown fields
SHALL be ignored. If any field other than <spanx style="verb">mx</spanx> is duplicated, the first entry
will be honored, the rest should be ignored.  For the <spanx style="verb">mx</spanx> field, all valid
entries will be utilized when enforcing the stated policy.
</t>
</section>

<section anchor="https-policy-fetching" title="HTTPS Policy Fetching">
<t>When fetching a new policy or updating a policy, the HTTPS endpoint MUST present
a X.509 certificate which is valid for the <spanx style="verb">mta-sts</spanx> host (as described below),
chain to a root CA that is trusted by the sending MTA, and be non-expired. It is
expected that sending MTAs use a set of trusted CAs similar to those in widely
deployed Web browsers and operating systems.
</t>
<t>The certificate is valid for the <spanx style="verb">mta-sts</spanx> host with respect to the rules
described in <xref target="RFC6125"/>, with the following application-specific
considerations:
</t>
<t>
<list style="symbols">
<t>Matching is performed only against the DNS-ID and CN-ID identifiers.</t>
<t>DNS domain names in server certificates MAY contain the wildcard character
'*' as the complete left-most label within the identifier.</t>
</list>
</t>
<t>The certificate MAY be checked for revocation via the Online Certificate Status
Protocol (OCSP) <xref target="RFC2560"/>, certificate revocation lists (CRLs), or some other
mechanism.
</t>
<t>HTTP 3xx redirects MUST NOT be followed.
</t>
<t>Senders may wish to rate-limit the frequency of attempts to fetch the HTTPS
endpoint even if a valid TXT record for the recipient domain exists. In the case
that the HTTPS GET fails, we suggest implementions may limit further attempts to
a period of five minutes or longer per version ID, to avoid overwhelming
resource-constrained recipients with cascading failures.
</t>
<t>Senders MAY impose a timeout on the HTTPS GET and/or a limit on the maximum size
of the response body to avoid long delays or resource exhaustion during
attempted policy updates. A suggested timeout is one minute, and a suggested
maximum policy size 64 kilobytes; policy hosts SHOULD respond to requests with a
complete policy body within that timeout and size limit.
</t>
<t>If a valid TXT record is found but no policy can be fetched via HTTPS (for any
reason), and there is no valid (non-expired) previously-cached policy, senders
MUST continue with delivery as though the domain has not implemented MTA-STS.
Senders who implement TLSRPT (TODO: add ref) should, however, report this
failure to the recipient domain if the domain implements TLSRPT as well.
</t>
<t>Conversely, if no &quot;live&quot; policy can be discovered via DNS or fetched via HTTPS,
but a valid (non-expired) policy exists in the sender's cache, the sender MUST
apply that cached policy.
</t>
</section>

<section anchor="policy-selection-for-smart-hosts-and-subdomains" title="Policy Selection for Smart Hosts and Subdomains">
<t>When sending mail via a &quot;smart host&quot;--an intermediate SMTP relay rather than the
message recipient's server--compliant senders MUST treat the smart host domain
as the policy domain for the purposes of policy discovery and application.
</t>
<t>When sending mail to a mailbox at a subdomain, compliant senders MUST NOT
attempt to fetch a policy from the parent zone. Thus for mail sent to
&quot;user@mail.example.com&quot;, the policy can be fetched only from &quot;mail.example.com&quot;,
not &quot;example.com&quot;.
</t>
</section>
</section>

<section anchor="policy-validation" title="Policy Validation">
<t>When sending to an MX at a domain for which the sender has a valid and
non-expired MTA-STS policy, a sending MTA honoring MTA-STS MUST validate:
</t>
<t>
<list style="numbers">
<t>That the recipient MX supports STARTTLS and offers a valid PKIX-based TLS
certificate.</t>
<t>That at least one of the policy's &quot;mx&quot; patterns matches at least one of the
identities presented in the MX's X.509 certificate, as described in &quot;MX
Certificate Validation&quot;.</t>
</list>
</t>
<t>This section does not dictate the behavior of sending MTAs when policies fail
to validate; in particular, validation failures of policies which specify
&quot;report&quot; mode MUST NOT be interpreted as delivery failures, as described in
<xref target="policy-application"/>, &quot;Policy Application&quot;.
</t>

<section anchor="mx-certificate-validation" title="MX Certificate Validation">
<t>The certificate presented by the receiving MX MUST chain to a root CA that is
trusted by the sending MTA and be non-expired. The certificate MUST have a CN-ID
(<xref target="RFC6125"/>) or SAN (<xref target="RFC5280"/>) with a DNS-ID matching the <spanx style="verb">mx</spanx> pattern. The
MX's certificate MAY also be checked for revocation via OCSP <xref target="RFC2560"/>,
certificate revocation lists (CRLs), or some other mechanism.
</t>
<t>Because the <spanx style="verb">mx</spanx> patterns are not hostnames, however, matching is not identical
to other common cases of X.509 certificate authentication (as described, for
example, in <xref target="RFC6125"/>). Consider the example policy given above, with an <spanx style="verb">mx</spanx>
pattern containing <spanx style="verb">.example.net</spanx>. In this case, if the MX server's X.509
certificate contains a SAN matching <spanx style="verb">*.example.net</spanx>, we are required to
implement &quot;wildcard-to-wildcard&quot; matching.
</t>
<t>To simplify this case, we impose the following constraints on wildcard
certificates, identical to those in <xref target="RFC7672"/> section 3.2.3 and [@!RFC6125
section 6.4.3: wildcards are valid in DNS-IDs or CN-IDs, but must be the entire
first label of the identifier (that is, <spanx style="verb">*.example.com</spanx>, not
<spanx style="verb">mail*.example.com</spanx>). Senders who are comparing a &quot;suffix&quot; MX pattern with a
wildcard identifier should thus strip the wildcard and ensure that the two sides
match label-by-label, until all labels of the shorter side (if unequal length)
are consumed.
</t>
<t>A simple pseudocode implementation of this algorithm is presented in the
Appendix.
</t>
</section>
</section>

<section anchor="policy-application" title="Policy Application">
<t>When sending to an MX at a domain for which the sender has a valid, non-expired
MTA-STS policy, a sending MTA honoring MTA-STS applies the result of a policy
validation failure one of two ways, depending on the value of the policy <spanx style="verb">mode</spanx>
field:
</t>
<t>
<list style="numbers">
<t><spanx style="verb">report</spanx>: In this mode, sending MTAs which also implement the TLSRPT
specification (TODO: add ref) merely send a report indicating policy
application failures (so long as TLSRPT is also implemented by the recipient
domain).</t>
<t><spanx style="verb">enforce</spanx>: In this mode, sending MTAs MUST NOT deliver the message to hosts
which fail MX matching or certificate validation.</t>
</list>
</t>
<t>When a message fails to deliver due to an <spanx style="verb">enforce</spanx> policy, a compliant MTA MUST
NOT permanently fail to deliver messages before checking for the presence of an
updated policy at the Policy Domain. (In all cases, MTAs SHOULD treat such
failures as transient errors and retry delivery later.) This allows implementing
domains to update long-lived policies on the fly.
</t>
<t>Finally, in both <spanx style="verb">enforce</spanx> and <spanx style="verb">report</spanx> modes, failures to deliver in compliance
with the applied policy result in failure reports to the policy domain, as
described in the TLSRPT specification (TODO: add ref).
</t>

<section anchor="policy-application-control-flow" title="Policy Application Control Flow">
<t>An example control flow for a compliant sender consists of the following steps:
</t>
<t>
<list style="numbers">
<t>Check for a cached policy whose time-since-fetch has not exceeded its
<spanx style="verb">max_age</spanx>. If none exists, attempt to fetch a new policy (perhaps
asynchronously, so as not to block message delivery). Optionally, sending
MTAs may unconditionally check for a new policy at this step.</t>
<t>For each candidate MX, in order of MX priority, attempt to deliver the
message, enforcing STARTTLS and, assuming a policy is present, PKIX
certificate validation as described in <xref target="mx-certificate-validation"/>, &quot;MX
Certificate Validation.&quot;</t>
<t>A message delivery MUST NOT be permanently failed until the sender has first
checked for the presence of a new policy (as indicated by the <spanx style="verb">id</spanx> field in
the <spanx style="verb">_mta-sts</spanx> TXT record). If a new policy is not found, existing rules for
the case of temporary message delivery failures apply (as discussed in
<xref target="RFC5321"/> section 4.5.4.1).</t>

</section>
</section>

<section anchor="operational-considerations" title="Operational Considerations">

<section anchor="policy-updates" title="Policy Updates">
<t>Updating the policy requires that the owner make changes in two places: the
<spanx style="verb">_mta-sts</spanx> TXT record in the Policy Domain's DNS zone and at the corresponding
HTTPS endpoint. As a result, recipients should expect a policy will continue to
be used by senders until both the HTTPS and TXT endpoints are updated and the
TXT record's TTL has passed.
</t>
<t>In other words, a sender who is unable to successfully deliver a message while
applying a cache of the recipient's now-outdated policy may be unable to
discover that a new policy exists until the DNS TTL has passed.  Recipients
should therefore ensure that old policies continue to work for message delivery
during this period of time, or risk message delays.
</t>
<t>Recipients should also prefer to update the HTTPS policy body before updating
the TXT record; this ordering avoids the risk that senders, seeing a new TXT
record, mistakenly cache the old policy from HTTPS.

<section anchor="security-considerations" title="Security Considerations">
<t>SMTP MTA Strict Transport Security attempts to protect against an active
attacker who wishes to intercept or tamper with mail between hosts who support
STARTTLS. There are two classes of attacks considered:
</t>
<t>
<list style="symbols">
<t>Foiling TLS negotiation, for example by deleting the &quot;250 STARTTLS&quot; response
from a server or altering TLS session negotiation. This would result in the
SMTP session occurring over plaintext, despite both parties supporting TLS.</t>
<t>Impersonating the destination mail server, whereby the sender might deliver
the message to an impostor, who could then monitor and/or modify messages
despite opportunistic TLS. This impersonation could be accomplished by
spoofing the DNS MX record for the recipient domain, or by redirecting client
connections intended for the legitimate recipient server (for example, by
altering BGP routing tables).</t>
</list>
</t>
<t>MTA-STS can thwart such attacks only if the sender is able to previously obtain
and cache a policy for the recipient domain, and only if the attacker is unable
to obtain a valid certificate that complies with that policy. Below, we consider
specific attacks on this model.
</t>

<section anchor="obtaining-a-signed-certificate" title="Obtaining a Signed Certificate">
<t>SMTP MTA-STS relies on certificate validation via PKIX based TLS identity
checking <xref target="RFC6125"/>. Attackers who are able to obtain a valid certificate for
the targeted recipient mail service (e.g. by compromising a certificate
authority) are thus able to circumvent STS authentication.
</t>
</section>

<section anchor="preventing-policy-discovery" title="Preventing Policy Discovery">
<t>Since MTA-STS uses DNS TXT records for policy discovery, an attacker who is able
to block DNS responses can suppress the discovery of an MTA-STS Policy, making
the Policy Domain appear not to have an MTA-STS Policy. The sender policy cache
is designed to resist this attack by decreasing the frequency of policy
discovery and thus reducing the window of vulnerability; it is nonetheless a
risk that attackers who can predict or induce policy discovery--for example, by
inducing a victim sending domain to send mail to a never-before-contacted
recipient while carrying out a man-in-the-middle attack--may be able to foil
policy discovery and effectively downgrade the security of the message delivery.
</t>
<t>Since this attack depends upon intercepting initial policy discovery, we
strongly recommend implementors to prefer policy <spanx style="verb">max_age</spanx> values to be as long
as is practical.
</t>
<t>Because this attack is also possible upon refresh of a cached policy, we suggest
implementors do not wait until a cached policy has expired before checking for
an update; if senders attempt to refresh the cache regularly (for instance, by
checking their cached version string against the TXT record on each successful
send, or in a background task that runs daily or weekly), an attacker would have
to foil policy discovery consistently over the lifetime of a cached policy to
prevent a successful refresh.
</t>
<t>Resistence to downgrade attacks of this nature--due to the ability to
authoritatively determine &quot;lack of a record&quot; even for non-participating
recipients--is a feature of DANE, due to its use of DNSSEC for policy discovery.

<t>We additionally consider the Denial of Service risk posed by an attacker who can
modify the DNS records for a victim domain. Absent MTA-STS, such an attacker can
cause a sending MTA to cache invalid MX records, but only for however long the
sending resolver caches those records. With MTA-STS, the attacker can
additionally advertise a new, long-<spanx style="verb">max_age</spanx> MTA-STS policy with <spanx style="verb">mx</spanx>
constraints that validate the malicious MX record, causing senders to cache the
policy and refuse to deliver messages once the victim has resecured the MX
records.
</t>
<t>This attack is mitigated in part by the ability of a victim domain to (at any
time) publish a new policy updating the cached, malicious policy, though this
does require the victim domain to both obtain a valid CA-signed certificate and
to understand and properly configure MTA-STS.
</t>
<t>Similarly, we consider the possibility of domains that deliberately allow
untrusted users to serve untrusted content on user-specified subdomains. In some
cases (e.g. the service Tumblr.com) this takes the form of providing HTTPS
hosting of user-registered subdomains; in other cases (e.g. dynamic DNS
providers) this takes the form of allowing untrusted users to register custom
DNS records at the provider's domain.
</t>
<t>In these cases, there is a risk that untrusted users would be able to serve
custom content at the <spanx style="verb">mta-sts</spanx> host, including serving an illegitimate MTA-STS
policy.  We believe this attack is rendered more difficult by the need for the
attacker to also serve the <spanx style="verb">_mta-sts</spanx> TXT record on the same domain--something
not, to our knowledge, widely provided to untrusted users. This attack is
additionally mitigated by the aforementioned ability for a victim domain to
update an invalid policy at any future date.
</t>

<section anchor="weak-policy-constraints" title="Weak Policy Constraints">
<t>Even if an attacker cannot modify a served policy, the potential exists for
configurations that allow attackers on the same domain to receive mail for that
domain. For example, an easy configuration option when authoring an MTA-STS Policy
for <spanx style="verb">example.com</spanx> is to set the <spanx style="verb">mx</spanx> equal to <spanx style="verb">.example.com</spanx>; recipient domains
must consider in this case the risk that any user possessing a valid hostname
and CA-signed certificate (for example, <spanx style="verb">dhcp-123.example.com</spanx>) will, from the
perspective of MTA-STS Policy validation, be a valid MX host for that domain.

<t>Below is pseudocode demonstrating the logic of a compliant sending MTA.

<t>While this pseudocode implementation suggests synchronous policy retrieval in
the delivery path, in a working implementation that may be undesirable, and we
expect some implementors to instead prefer a background fetch that does not
block delivery if no cached policy is present.
