<abstract>
<t>A number of protocols exist for establishing encrypted channels between SMTP
Mail Transfer Agents, including STARTTLS <xref target="RFC3207"/>, DANE <xref target="RFC6698"/>, and
MTA-STS (TODO: Add ref). These protocols can fail due to misconfiguration or
active attack, leading to undelivered messages or delivery over unencrypted or
unauthenticated channels. This document describes a reporting mechanism and
format by which sending systems can share statistics and specific information
about potential failures with recipient domains. Recipient domains can then use
this information to both detect potential attackers and diagnose unintentional
misconfigurations.
</t>
</abstract>

<section anchor="introduction" title="Introduction">
<t>The STARTTLS extension to SMTP <xref target="RFC3207"/> allows SMTP clients and hosts to
establish secure SMTP sessions over TLS. The protocol design is based on
&quot;Opportunistic Security&quot; (OS) <xref target="RFC7435"/>, which maintains interoperability with
clients that do not support STARTTLS but means that any attacker who can delete
parts of the SMTP session (such as the &quot;250 STARTTLS&quot; response) or redirect the
entire SMTP session (perhaps by overwriting the resolved MX record of the
delivery domain) can perform a downgrade or interception attack.
</t>
<t>Because such &quot;downgrade attacks&quot; are not necessarily apparent to the receiving
MTA, this document defines a mechanism for sending domains to report on failures
at multiple stages of the MTA-to-MTA conversation.
</t>
<t>Recipient domains may also use the mechanisms defined by MTA-STS (TODO: Add ref)
or DANE <xref target="RFC6698"/> to publish additional encryption and authentication
requirements; this document defines a mechanism for sending domains that are
compatible with MTA-STS or DANE to share success and failure statistics with
recipient domains.
</t>
<t>Specifically, this document defines a reporting schema that covers failures in
routing, STARTTLS negotiation, and both DANE <xref target="RFC6698"/> and MTA-STS (TODO: Add
ref) policy validation errors, and a standard TXT record that recipient domains
can use to indicate where reports in this format should be sent.
</t>
<t>This document is intended as a companion to the specification for SMTP MTA
Strict Transport Security (MTA-STS, TODO: Add ref).

<section anchor="reporting-policy" title="Reporting Policy">
<t>A domain publishes a record to its DNS indicating that it wishes to
receive reports. These SMTP TLSRPT policies are distributed via DNS from the
Policy Domain's zone, as TXT records (similar to DMARC policies) under the name
<spanx style="verb">_smtp-tlsrpt</spanx>. For example, for the Policy Domain <spanx style="verb">example.com</spanx>, the
recipient's TLSRPT policy can be retrieved from <spanx style="verb">_smtp-tlsrpt.example.com</spanx>.
</t>
<t>Policies consist of the following directives:
</t>
<t>
<list style="symbols">
<t><spanx style="verb">v</spanx>: This value MUST be equal to <spanx style="verb">TLSRPTv1</spanx>.</t>
<t><spanx style="verb">rua</spanx>: A URI specifying the endpoint to which aggregate information about
 policy failures should be sent (see the section <spanx style="emph">Reporting</spanx> <spanx style="emph">Schema</spanx> for
 more information). Two URI schemes are supported: <spanx style="verb">mailto</spanx> and <spanx style="verb">https</spanx>.
<list style="symbols">
<t>In the case of <spanx style="verb">https</spanx>, reports should be submitted via POST
   (<xref target="RFC2818"/>) to the specified URI.</t>
<t>In the case of <spanx style="verb">mailto</spanx>, reports should be submitted to the specified
   email address. When sending failure reports via SMTP, sending MTAs
   MUST deliver reports despite any TLS-related failures.  This may
mean that the reports are delivered in the clear.</t>
</list></t>
</list>
</t>
<t>The formal definition of the <spanx style="verb">_smtp-tlsrpt</spanx> TXT record, defined using
<xref target="RFC5234"/>, is as follows:
</t>

<figure align="center"><artwork align="center">
    tlsrpt-record    = tlsrpt-version *WSP %x3B tlsrpt-rua

    tlsrpt-version   = "v" *WSP "=" *WSP %x54 %x4C %x53

    tlsrpt-rua       = "rua" *WSP "=" *WSP tlsrpt-uri

    tlsrpt-uri       = URI
                     ; "URI" is imported from [@!RFC3986]; commas (ASCII
                     ; 0x2C) and exclamation points (ASCII 0x21)
                     ; MUST be encoded; the numeric portion MUST fit
                     ; within an unsigned 64-bit integer
</artwork></figure>
<t>If multiple TXT records for <spanx style="verb">_smtp-tlsrpt</spanx> are returned by the resolver, records
which do not begin with <spanx style="verb">v=TLSRPTv1;</spanx> are discarded. If the number of resulting
records is not one, senders MUST assume the recipient domain does not implement
TLSRPT.

<t>The extension MUST be &quot;json&quot; for a plain JSON file, or &quot;json.gz&quot; for a
   JSON file compressed using GZIP.
</t>
<t>&quot;unique-id&quot; allows an optional unique ID generated by the Sending MTA to
   distinguish among multiple reports generated simultaneously by different
   sources within the same Policy Domain. For example, this is a possible
   filename for the gzip file of a report to the Policy Domain &quot;example.net&quot;

<section anchor="compression" title="Compression">
<t>The report SHOULD be subjected to GZIP compression for both email and HTTPS
transport. Declining to apply compression can cause the report to be too large

compressing the file increases the chances of acceptance of the report at some
compute cost.
</t>

<section anchor="email-transport" title="Email Transport">
<t>The report MAY be delivered by email. No specific MIME message structure is
required. It is presumed that the aggregate reporting address will be equipped

<t>The <xref target="RFC5322"/>.Subject field for individual report submissions SHOULD

</artwork></figure>
<t>The first domain-name indicates the DNS domain name about which the
   report was generated.  The second domain-name indicates the DNS
   domain name representing the Sending MTA generating the report.
   The purpose of the Report-ID: portion of the field is to enable the
   Policy Domain to identify and ignore duplicate reports that might be
   sent by a Sending MTA.
</t>
<t>For instance, this is a possible Subject field for a report to the
   Policy Domain &quot;example.net&quot; from the Sending MTA
   &quot;mail.sender.example.com&quot;.  It is line-wrapped as allowed by <xref target="RFC5322"/>:

MTA-STS or DANE TLSA failures.

<section anchor="security-considerations" title="Security Considerations">
<t>SMTP TLS Reporting provides transparency into misconfigurations or attempts to
intercept or tamper with mail between hosts who support STARTTLS. There are
several security risks presented by the existence of this reporting channel:
</t>
<t>
<list style="symbols">
<t>Flooding of the Aggregate report URI (rua) endpoint: An attacker could
flood the endpoint and prevent the receiving domain from accepting
additional reports. This type of Denial-of-Service attack would limit
visibility into STARTTLS failures, leaving the receiving domain blind to an
ongoing attack.</t>
<t>Untrusted content: An attacker could inject malicious code into the
report, opening a vulnerability in the receiving domain. Implementers are
advised to take precautions against evaluating the contents of the report.</t>
<t>Report snooping: An attacker could create a bogus TLSRPT record to receive
statistics about a domain the attacker does not own. Since an attacker able
to poison DNS is already able to receive counts of SMTP connections (and,
absent DANE or MTA-STS policies, actual SMTP message payloads), this
does not present a significant new vulnerability.</t>
<t>Reports as DDoS: TLSRPT allows specifying destinations for the reports that
are outside the authority of the Policy Domain, which allows domains to
delegate processing of reports to a partner organization. However, an attacker
who controls the Policy Domain DNS could also use this mechanism to direct the
reports to an unwitting victim, flooding that victim with excessive reports.
DMARC <xref target="RFC7489"/> defines an elegant solution for verifying delegation;
however, since the attacker had less ability to generate large reports than
with DMARC failures, and since the reports are generated by the sending MTA,
such a delegation mechanism is left for a future version of this
specification.</t>
